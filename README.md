Unzip files from .zip archives in JavaScript.

## Install
```sh
 $ npm install michaelrhodes/zipfile.js
```

## Usage
Pass the .zip file to the constructor as an ArrayBuffer. read() will return an Uint8Array of the uncompressed data for each file. I didn't add an API to list files yet because my use case didn't need it. Patches welcome!

```js
var ZipFile = require('zipfile');
var zip = new ZipFile(arrayBuffer);
var data = zip.read("file.txt");
```
